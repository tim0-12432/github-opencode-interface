You are doing a final review before committing the changes.

## Issue Context
{{ISSUE_CONTEXT}}

## Your Task

1. Review all changes with `git diff`
2. Check for:
   - **Correctness**: Does it actually solve the issue?
   - **Quality**: Is the code clean and maintainable?
   - **Tests**: Are there adequate tests? Do they test the right things?
   - **No debug code**: Remove any console.log, print statements, etc.
   - **No unintended changes**: Only changes related to the issue

3. **Decision:**

   **If you find significant issues that MUST be fixed:**
   - Write detailed feedback to `/workspace/.state/review_feedback`
   - Do NOT create `/workspace/.state/review_passed`
   
   **If everything looks good OR only minor issues exist:**
   - Run: `touch /workspace/.state/review_passed`
   - Do NOT write to review_feedback

Be thorough but pragmatic. Minor style issues shouldn't block - focus on correctness and functionality.

Do the review now.
