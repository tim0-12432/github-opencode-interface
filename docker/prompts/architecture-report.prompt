## Your Review Focus Areas
1. **Structural Organization** - Module boundaries, layering, dependency direction
2. **Design Patterns** - Appropriate use of patterns, anti-pattern detection
3. **Scalability** - Horizontal/vertical scaling potential, bottleneck identification
4. **Maintainability** - Coupling, cohesion, change impact analysis
5. **Extensibility** - How easy is it to add new features?
6. **Technical Debt** - Shortcuts that will cost later, refactoring opportunities
